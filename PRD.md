## Design Direction

The interface should feel like a professional design tool extension - clean, focused, and unobtrusive, matching Wikimedia's Codex design system with Wikipedia's familiar blue link styling.

## Color Selection

Custom palette following Wikimedia Foundation's Codex design system
- **Primary Color**: Wikipedia Blue (#0645ad) - Communicates trust and knowledge, used for all links
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (#eaecf0, #a2a9b1) for backgrounds and subtle elements
- **Accent Color**: Red (#d33) for error states and destructive actions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White #ffffff): Dark text (#222222) - Ratio 9.3:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray #f8f9fa): Dark text (#222222) - Ratio 8.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Wikipedia Blue #0645ad): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should match Wikipedia's readable, academic character using system fonts for consistency across platforms.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Plugin Title): System Sans Bold/24px/tight spacing
  - H2 (Article Titles): System Sans Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Article Content): System Sans Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Citations): System Sans Regular/12px/superscript positioning

## Animations

Subtle, functional animations that provide feedback without distraction, maintaining the professional tool aesthetic.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Quick micro-interactions that confirm actions and guide attention to important state changes
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Search suggestions slide in smoothly, content loads with gentle fade, minimal bounce effects

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Input for search, Card for article results, custom formatted text display for content
- **Customizations**: Wikipedia-style link formatting, superscript citation styling, search result layout
- **States**: Search input (empty, typing, results), content (loading, loaded, error), links (default, hover)
- **Icon Selection**: Search icon, external link indicators, loading spinners
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px grid system, generous padding for readability
- **Mobile**: Responsive design with touch-friendly targets, collapsible sections for smaller screens
